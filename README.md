# Android News App with Kotlin and Jetpack

Welcome to the Android News App project! This Android application is built using the latest Kotlin programming language and leverages the power of Jetpack libraries to deliver a modern and feature-rich news experience.

## Features

- **Modern Kotlin Codebase**: This app is written entirely in Kotlin, taking advantage of Kotlin's concise syntax and advanced features.

- **Jetpack Libraries**: We have embraced the Android Jetpack libraries to ensure robustness, scalability, and maintainability. Key Jetpack components include LiveData, ViewModel, and Navigation.

- **MVVM Architecture**: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, which promotes separation of concerns and ease of testing.

- **News API Integration**: We fetch the latest news articles from a reputable news API, providing users with up-to-date information.

- **Responsive UI**: The app's user interface is designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and orientations, providing an optimal user experience on both phones and tablets.

- **Offline Mode**: Users can access previously viewed news articles even when offline, thanks to local data caching.

- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for specific news topics or articles using the built-in search feature.


## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language for Android development.

- **Android Jetpack**: Utilizing Jetpack components for architectural guidance and to simplify complex tasks.

- **Retrofit**: A powerful HTTP client for network requests.

- **Room Database**: A robust, object-oriented database library for local data storage.

- **Coroutines**: Handling asynchronous operations efficiently and with less boilerplate code.

- **LiveData**: Lifecycle-aware data observation for UI updates.

- **ViewModel**: Separation of UI-related data and handling configuration changes.

- **Navigation Component**: Simplifying navigation and deep linking within the app.
